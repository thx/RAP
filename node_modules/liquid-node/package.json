Template engines which don't produce good looking markup are no fun to use.\n* It needs to be non evaling and secure. Liquid templates are made so that users can edit them. You don't want to run code on your server which your users wrote.\n* It has to be stateless. Compile and render steps have to be seperate so that the expensive parsing and compiling can be done once and later on you can just render it passing in a hash with local variables and objects.\n\n## Why you should use Liquid\n\n* You want to allow your users to edit the appearance of your application but don't want them to run **insecure code on your server**.\n* You want to render templates directly from the database\n* You like smarty (PHP) style template engines\n* You need a template engine which does HTML just as well as emails\n* You don't like the markup of your current templating engine\n\n## What does it look like?\n\n```html\n<ul id=\"products\">\n  {% for product in products %}\n    <li>\n      <h2>{{ product.name }}</h2>\n      Only {{ product.price | price }}\n\n      {{ product.description | prettyprint | paragraph }}\n    </li>\n  {% endfor %}\n</ul>\n```\n\n## Howto use Liquid\n\nLiquid supports a very simple API based around the Liquid.Template class.\nFor standard use you can just pass it the content of a file and call render with an object.\n\n```coffeescript\nLiquid = require \"liquid-node\"\n\ntemplate = Liquid.Template.parse(\"hi {{name}}\") # Parses and compiles the template\npromise = template.render name: \"tobi\"          # => [Promise Object]\npromise.done console.log                        # >> \"hi tobi\"\n```\n\n## Promises with Q\n\nLiquidNode uses the promise implementation of [Q](https://github.com/kriskowal/q).\n\n```coffeescript\nfs = require \"fs\"\nQ  = require \"q\"\n\nclass Server\n  name: ->\n    \"Falkor\"\n\n  # A deferred can either be resolved (no error) or rejected (error).\n  think: ->\n    Q.timeout(1000).then(42)\n\n  # This is an example of how to wait for a Promise:\n  patientMethod: ->\n    deepThought = @think()\n    deepThought.done (answer) -> console.log \"The answer is: %s.\", answer\n    deepThought.fail (e) -> console.log \"Universe reset: %s.\", e\n\n  # For node-ish callbacks you can use `defer.nodeify`. This\n  # will automatically resolve/reject based on the first argument.\n  accounts: ->\n    deferred = Q.defer()\n    fs.readFile \"/etc/passwd\", \"utf-8\", deferred.nodeify\n\n  # If you don't want to check, whether an object is a Promise or not\n  # just use `Q.when`. It will build a Promise around it if necessary.\n  unsure: (promiseWannabe) ->\n    Q.when(promiseWannabe)\n\n  # You can chain Promises using `promise.then().then().then()...`.\n  # A `then` will be called with the resolution of the previous `then`.\n  recipe: ->\n    gotoStore()\n      .then (store) -> store.getEggs()\n      .then (eggs) ->\n        # or nest the when-calls\n        eggs.split().then (yolk) -> bakeWith(yolk)\n      .done (pancake) ->\n        console.log \"Pancake is ready!\"\n```\n\n## State of development\n\nI'm developing this project alongside a different project.\nI translated a few basic tests from the original Liquid codebase -\nbut there are hundreds of them.\n\nSo if you find a bug-fix or have some time to translate further tests I'll be happy to pull them in.\n\n## Similar libraries\n\n* [darthapo's Liquid.js](https://github.com/darthapo/liquid.js) is liquid ported to JavaScript to be run within the browser. It doesn't handle asynchrony.\n* [tchype's Liquid.js](https://github.com/tchype/liquid.js) is `liquid-node` wrapped to run in a browser.\n\n## License\n\nLiquidNode is released under the [MIT license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\n",
